					<p>Michael Billinger, walks to the edge of the water. It’s minus 15 degrees, freezing to most, but the water level is high, all that matters to him. He steps into the Ottawa River, his surf board held by his side, takes three steps and launches himself, stomach flat to the board while he paddles out. He holds onto the wake cord and pulls himself up until he has his balance, then let’s go — he’s riding the sewer wave. </p>
					<p>The sewer wave is one of three major waves river surfers ride, located on the Gatineau side of the Ottawa River. It received its name due to being formed by running water splashing over a sewer drain near the shore. </p>
					<p>The sewer wave is known as the easiest, one that beginners tend to love. It is close to the shore making it the most accessible.   Along with the sewer wave there is bate island, also referred to as the Champlain Bridge wave, Billinger said the Bate Island wave is for experts only, as it is the most difficult. The final wave is the desert wave also known as dessert wave. Billinger claims it is the dessert wave because it’s a sweet treat after going through bate island wave.</p>
					<p> “The story goes that it’s actually dessert wave because once you go through the rapids at Bate Island, you keep going and it’s like dessert,” he said. “It’s like icing on the cake because it’s a really big nice wave.”</p>

					<div id="map"></div>

					<p> Billinger is one of the veterans who surf the Ottawa River, discovering it 10 years ago. However, his journey with surfing didn’t start in Ottawa, it didn’t even start in North America. </p>

					<p>Billinger learned to surf in Argentina, and he still remembers his first wave he rode — he said the feeling was irreplaceable. “Especially when you get one on your own, you’re just hooked, just totally hooked,” Billinger said with a smile. Billinger moved to Edmonton after getting back from Argentina where he was surprised to find he could continue surfing. “There’s a really dedicated surf community in Edmonton,” he said. This was where Billinger first tried river surfing, similar but different from ocean surfing. While ocean surfing has recurring waves, river surfing relies on one constantly forming wave. The sport was first documented in Munich, Germany in the 1970’s. The city embraces this history as it has a wave at the airport that passengers can surf on. Billinger said Edmonton’s surf community is what Ottawa strives to achieve. This includes making adjustable artificial waves for themselves through fundraising and lobbying various levels of government. “They are doing a lot of really innovative ways of creating new waves,” Billinger said.  “That’s one of the things we’d like to see happen here in Ottawa.” Billinger moved to Ottawa in 2010 and wanted to keep surfing — so he searched the internet to see where the good spots were. “I was looking up some videos on YouTube and saw there were some videos of people surfing here,” Billinger said. From there he messaged Michael Crichton, a veteran surfer of the Ottawa River, asking if he could join them when the spring melt occurs. “[Crichton] took it upon himself to contact me when that happened and say, ‘hey we’re going, come on out’,” Billinger said. Crichton’s been surfing every summer since he was child when his family would take him and his brothers to North Carolina. Despite being so young he said he too could never forget riding his first wave. “I absolutely remember my very first wave that I caught,” Crichton said with a laugh. “It was right before dinner the sun was going down… I remember getting up on the wave, standing there, maintaining the balance and being like ‘holy crap I’m surfing.’ ” Crichton continued his love with surfing in Ottawa, taking it to the river. He said he can’t remember the exact time surfing started on the Ottawa River but believes it to be at least 20-25 years ago starting at the Champlain Bridge. Steven Perreault, Ottawa River Surfer and employee Surf Side, a surf store in Ottawa, said the first to discover the waves were kayakers. “The surfable spots are all by the kayaker’s holes, a standing wave that folds over on itself,” Perreault said. A new and growing sport, but one not without its dangers, danger Perreault knows too well. “I have some decent little scars and bumps,” Perreault said of his surfing accidents. He said there are risks in the river that don’t exist in the oceans, such as rocks when the water level is low as well as floating chunks of ice. Billinger said safety should be the most important component to new surfers and that starts with the right gear. “They need the right equipment,” Billinger said. “In terms of wetsuits, gloves and boots… We recommend new surfers wear helmets.” Billinger said he considers himself lucky as he has never had a serious injury from surfing and he credits that to taking the proper precautions. Despite the risks, Billinger said being on the river is when the day because it’s when concerns melt away.“All the work and stress and everything is just out of your mind when you’re surfing, it’s just relaxing and you’re with your friends,” Billinger said. </p>

						<p> A customer walks into Surf Side, Ottawa’s only surf store. She isn’t a surfer but a kayaker who plans to travel a river in the Northwest Territories. Although she doesn’t practice what the store is named after, she receives extensive aid from store owner, Alex Millen. He helps her find the proper wetsuit for the cold arctic river, listens to her story of past rivers she’s kayaked and shares some of his own stories. She leaves with a new wetsuit and some advice for her upcoming trip. </p>

						<p> Located in the West end of Ottawa is the city’s only surf store, Surf Side.  The store that is going onto 35 years old, was started by Millen and his father Rick. </p>
						<p> Originally a windsurfing shop before embracing all types of board sports, including windsurfing, skateboarding, kiteboarding, waterskiing, wakeboarding and snowboarding. </p>
						
						<blockquote>
							<p> “Pretty much anything with the word boarding on the end of it, we do it,” Millen said.  </p>
							<footer>Alex Millen</footer>
						</blockquote>

						<p> The store has a long history of serving the communities needs for non motorized sports. Surf Side doesn’t look like something that would be found in a city away from the ocean — the walls are covered by various surf company stickers and boards of all kinds. </p>

						<p> “Pretty much your California board shop, we try to keep that vibe,” Millen said. </p>

						<p> Not only does Millen sell the equipment, but he uses it as well. He said he has been surfing for a long time but it’s only in the past two years he began river surfing. </p>

						<div id="equipment"></div>

						<p> “Actual surfing, I tried it a few times, never really mastered it, but for the past few years I’ve been doing the Ottawa River standing wave surfing,” Millen said.  </p>


						<p> Millen surfs with his coworker Steven Perreault, something Perreault said is convenient as it’s encouraged not to surf alone. </p>

						<p> The store is stocked up on all the necessary equipment for Ottawa’s River surfers, including wetsuits, gloves, and boots all of which is part of the river surfing attire. The river surfers wear six millimeter thick wetsuits to protect themselves from the cold of the Ottawa River. </p>

						<p> Perreault explained river surfers need to have all the equipment mentioned as the temperature of the Ottawa River is a major danger when surfing. </p>
						<p> The components that make the sport popular are the same as what makes it unpopular — the cost. </p>

						<p> Millen said he enjoyed wakeboarding, but the sport is impossible to do without owning a boat. Although river surfing is cheaper than wakeboarding, it’s still an expensive sport. </p>

						<p> Surf boards range from $300-1000, wetsuits can be between $200-500, a leash that ties the surfer to the board is around $40 and gloves and boots are separately around $50. Making the price to get started, somewhere between $600-1,650. That still doesn’t account for the damage the board is likely to sustain from rocks and ice, a repair costing between $40-100. </p>

						<p> However, Michael Billinger, veteran river surfer said there are ways around this. He said they have a Facebook group where experienced surfers are willing to lend out their equipment for newcomers. Perreault has begun a rental program at Surf Side where people can borrow the appropriate equipment. </p>

						<p> Surf Side has had a large impact on the surf community in Ottawa, providing the surfers with the appropriate equipment. Although they lost one of the most dedicated members this year. Alex Cobb, a longtime worker was instrumental in organizing the first official river surf jam, Ottawa’s first surf competition. Cobb moved to Toronto two months ago, leaving Millen and Perreault to surf alone. </p>

						<p> Millen said he is happy with his stores role in the surfing community, but he understands it isn’t as big as it would be in another area. </p>

						<p> “Obviously if there was an ocean right there and a lot of big waves, there’d be a lot more surf boards,” he said. “Maybe I would’ve retired with a big stack of money.” </p>
